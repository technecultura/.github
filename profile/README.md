# Welcome!

Technēculturǎ is a research institute, policy incubator, and creative hub working to advance global equity in AI. 

Led by Dr. Chinasa T. Okolo, we integrate an interdisciplinary lens to produce research and policy analysis on the sociocultural limitations and geopolitical implications of AI. Our mission is to reframe public understanding of the global AI divide, inform comprehensive policy implementation, and promote globally-inclusive approaches to AI development.
